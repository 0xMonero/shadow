The Shadow Simulator <shadow-support@cs.umn.edu>

Shadow is a unique discrete-event network simulator that runs real-life 
applications like Tor. Shadow combines the accuracy of emulation with the 
efficiency and control of simulation, achieving the best of both approaches.

Also included are core plug-ins and topologies for transferring files between 
clients and servers, and over a private Tor anonymity network.

Quick Setup (installs everything in ~/.shadow):
    $ ./setup dependencies
