use the scripts in shadow/contrib to modify the maps:
  1. full_tor_map.xml --generate-topology.py--> topology.full.graphml.xml
  2. topology.full.graphml.xml --prune-topology-relays.py--> topology.pruned.graphml.xml
  3. topology.pruned.graphml.xml --compute-topology-paths.py--> topology.complete.graphml.xml
  4. topology.complete.graphml.xml --collapse-topology.py--> topology.graphml.xml

files:
  -full_tor_map.xml:
   undirected connected map from chris wacek
  -topology.full.graphml.xml:
   undrected connected map with unnecessary attributes stripped out, in a format that shadow understands (not complete, so shadow must run shortest path on this map)
  -topology.pruned.graphml.xml:
   the full topology with the relays that are not used in a given simulation pruned out, so that we dont have to compute so many shortest paths. however, shadow still must compute the shortest paths.
  -topology.complete.graphml.xml:
   undirected, connected, complete graph with shortest paths pre-computed
  -topology.graphml.xml
   collapsed version of the complete graph, where nodes are clustered by country code instead of pop/poi. shortest paths are not necessary since the graph is complete.
  -topology.plab.graphml.xml:
   the shadow topology created from the old planet lab dataset
   its a complete graph so shortest path is not necessary inside of shadow

TODO:
  -some scripts require data from netindex - document this
  -make_test_graph.py is outdated
  -convert-topology.py is outdated
